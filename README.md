This project investigates event classification on structured scientific data using Masked Transformer Autoencoders (MTAE). A self-supervised pretraining strategy based on random feature masking and reconstruction is employed to learn latent representations that capture temporal and contextual dependencies in the data. These learned representations are subsequently used for downstream event classification. Experimental evaluation is conducted on the UCI Human Activity Recognition dataset.
